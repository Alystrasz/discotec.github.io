# Instructions for all Attendees

We strongly encourage you to download and install the [Zoom client](https://zoom.us) before the conference, to resolve any unforeseen problems you may encounter ahead of time. 


## Joining a Webinar

An ongoing Zoom webinar can be joined by following these instructions.

## Asking Questions During Presentations

The following procedure should be used to ask questions:

1. Click the `Q&A` from the Zoom dock. The dock is located at the top or bottom of your screen.

2. The `Q&A` panel pops up. This panel organises questions in two tabs: `All questions` and `My questions`. `All questions` lists the questions that **have been answered** by the presenter; these will be visible to all webinar attendees. The `My questions` tab shows the questions that you have asked.

    To pose a question to the presenter, type the question and press `Send`. The presenter receiving your question may then choose to address your question. Questions will be answered by presenters live over the mic. Any questions that remain unaddressed by presenters will only be visible in your `Q&A` panel, and are not seen by others.

3. If and when your question is addressed by the presenter, you will be automatically given the option to **unmute your mic** in case you wish to ask further follow up questions. Press `Unmute` to enable your mic.

    At any point, the *session chair* may intervene to help steer the discussion or provide additional clarification.    

4. Once the question has been answered, your mic will be muted automatically.


## Asking Questions During Tutorials

During tutorials, you may wish to share your screen to ask for assistance.

Follow steps 1-4 [above](#asking-questions-during-presentations). To request that your screen is shared, ask your host verbally over the mic.

Press `Share screen` to share your screen with the other attendees.

<!-- Questions posed by attendees will appear in the *Q&A* popup window as shown. The popup has two tabs *All questions* and *My questions*; *All questions* shows all the available questions which the speaker may choose to address or otherwise. Answered questions become visible by the audience once answered, and may be viewed in the *My questions* tab. -->
