## Local transportation
[This website](https://www.publictransport.com.mt) provides a good overview of public transportation in Malta.

### From Malta International Airport to the Valletta Campus
Take the bus X4, X5 or X7 (direction Valletta).  You should get off at the last stop, the main bus terminus of the island which is located right at the entrance of the city. 


<!-- 
### From Lyngby Station to the Campus
In order to reach the campus from Lyngby station, you should take a bus (several cover this route, e.g. 30E, 190, 300S). You should get off at DTU (Anker Engelunds Vej). [See the journey on Goole Maps](https://goo.gl/maps/V1EynwTaQfT6bsNN9) 
-->

### Tickets
There are a number of options and fares. Please consult [this link](https://www.publictransport.com.mt/en/bus-card-and-ticketing).


<!-- 
Regarding tickets, we recommend buying a [rejsekort anonymous](https://www.rejsekort.dk/koeb-rejsekort/salgssteder.aspx?sps=0edb084e941a4ebd878bdd1080538881%7C). It is a rechargable card which allows to pay tickets half price. E.g., a one way from Copenhagen to DTU costs about 4 EUR rather than 8 EUR (furthermore, there is a further 20% discount if travelling from 11 AM to 1 PM, from 6 PM to 6 AM, or during the weekends). The card costs about 10 EUR. Please remember that at least 70 DKK must be in the card in order to use it. Also, please note that it is not possible to recharge it at DTU campus.

Another option is the [large citypass](https://dinoffentligetransport.dk/citypass). It can be done for 1,2,3,4, or 5 days. 5 days costs about 80 EUR, and allows you to travel freely in the greater Copenhagen area.

If you are interested in visiting the many museums present in Copenhagen, then you might also consider a [Copenhagen Card](https://copenhagencard.com/free-public-transport). It is a more expensive version of the city pass which also grants you free access to several museums and attractions.

## Accommodation and local information

TBA

<!-- 
Hotels in Copenhagen (recommended)
* We recommend to stay close to the Nørreport station, as it is central area of the city and it is very well connected with both the Airport (direct metro line, 15 minutes) and with the campus (bus lines 150S and 15E, 25 minutes). You will have to commute every day to the campus (half an hour each way) but it will be easier to enjoy the beautiful city of Copenhagen and to find nice restaurants for dinner.
* A list of hotels in that area can be found in [booking.com](https://www.booking.com/searchresults.en-gb.html?label=gen173nr-1BCAEoggJCAlhYSDNYBGg9iAEBmAEGuAEHyAEM2AEB6AEBkgIBeagCAw&sid=526f40f28fb1d9d93bba8d197e3c8adb&class_interval=1&dest_id=1764&dest_type=landmark&dtdisc=0&from_sf=1&group_adults=2&group_children=0&inac=0&index_postcard=0&label_click=undef&lang=en-gb&map=1&no_rooms=1&offset=0&postcard=0&raw_dest_type=landmark&room1=A%2CA&sb_price_type=total&search_selected=1&soz=1&src=index&src_elem=sb&ss=N%C3%B8rreport%20Station%2C%20K%C3%B8benhavn%2C%20Region%20Hovedstaden%2C%20Danmark&ss_all=0&ss_raw=n%C3%B8rreport&ssb=empty&sshis=0&lang_click=top&cdl=da&lang_changed=1&nflt=#map_closed).

Remember to adapt the search criteria to your needs.

Hotels in Lyngby
* If you prefer to stay close to the campus and avoid the commute we recommend the [Scandic Eremitage](https://www.scandichotels.dk/hoteller/danmark/kobenhavn/scandic-eremitage) (expensive, located in the center of Lyngby, close to public transportation), [Post Gaarden](https://www.postgaardenhotel.dk/) (cheaper, located in the center of Lyngby, close to public transportation), and the [Hotel Fortunen](http://www.fortunen.dk/) (cozy and cheap, better suited for bike commuting, not well connected with public transportation but you can rent bikes at the hotel).
* Further options can be found in [booking.com](https://www.booking.com/searchresults.en-gb.html?label=gen173nr-1FCAEoggJCAlhYSDNYBGg9iAEBmAEGuAEHyAEM2AEB6AEB-AELkgIBeagCAw&sid=526f40f28fb1d9d93bba8d197e3c8adb&class_interval=1&dest_id=-2745593&dest_type=city&from_sf=1&group_adults=2&group_children=0&label_click=undef&lang=en-gb&no_rooms=1&offset=0&raw_dest_type=city&room1=A%2CA&sb_price_type=total&search_selected=1&soz=1&src=index&src_elem=sb&ss=Kongens%20Lyngby%2C%20Region%20Hovedstaden%2C%20Danmark&ss_raw=lyngb&ssb=empty&lang_click=top&cdl=da&lang_changed=1&nflt=).
