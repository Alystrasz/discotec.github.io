Marco graduated with honors in Computer Science at the University of L’Aquila in April 2004, and he received his PhD in April 2008 with the best grade.

He is (has been) involved in several EU and Italian research and development projects, as scientific coordinator, scientific and technical project leader, research unit coordinator, and work package leader. He is (co-)author of over 80 publications in international journals, conference proceedings, and books. He is serving as reviewer for several international conferences, workshops, and top level international journals.

Main research areas are Software Engineering, Distributed Systems, Context-oriented Programming, and Formal Methods. In these areas, main research & development activities include (i) automated software synthesis for composing complex distributed systems, from system architecture to integration code, from coordination to protocol mediation/adaptation; (ii) modeling and analysis of complex distributed systems; (iii) automated synthesis of context-aware (mobile) applications; (iv) resource-oriented analysis of adaptable (mobile) applications; (v) formal specification and checking of temporal properties.

He actively works on the (from theory to practice) application of software engineering methods to the modeling, verification, analysis and automatic synthesis of complex distributed systems, and application of context-oriented programming and analysis techniques to the development of adaptable (mobile) applications.

Recently, he is working on the definition of architectural patterns for creating robust, reliable and efficient microservice-based systems, and on the definition of methods and techniques to transform a monolithic system to a microservice-based one.
