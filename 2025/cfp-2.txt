DisCoTec 2025 is one of the major events sponsored by the International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP) and the European Association for Programming Languages and Systems (EAPLS). It gathers conferences and satellite events that cover a broad spectrum of distributed computing subjects — from theoretical foundations and formal description techniques, testing and verification methods, to language design and system implementation approaches. The three main conferences are:

* COORDINATION 2025 - International Conference on Coordination Models and Languages
* DAIS 2025 - International Conference on Distributed Applications and Interoperable Systems
* FORTE 2025 - International Conference on Formal Techniques for Distributed Objects, Components, and Systems

DisCoTec 2025 is organised by Inria Lille and the University of Lille. It will be hosted by Polytech Lille.
