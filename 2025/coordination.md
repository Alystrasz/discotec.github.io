# COORDINATION 2025 - 27th International Conference on Coordination Models and Languages

COORDINATION 2025 is one of the three conferences of [DisCoTec 2025](.).

## Scope
Modern information systems rely increasingly on combining concurrent, distributed, mobile, adaptive, reconfigurable and heterogeneous components. New models, architectures, languages and verification techniques are necessary to cope with the complexity induced by the demands of today’s software development. Coordination languages have emerged as a successful approach, in that they provide abstractions that cleanly separate behaviour from communication, therefore increasing modularity, simplifying reasoning, and ultimately enhancing software development. Building on the success of the previous editions, this conference provides a well-established forum for the growing community of researchers interested in models, languages, rchitectures, and implementation techniques for coordination.

## Main topics
Topics of interest encompass all areas of coordination, including (but not limited to) coordination related aspects of:
* Theoretical models and foundations for coordination: component composition, concurrency, distribution, mobility; dynamic, spatial and probabilistic aspects of coordination; logic, types, semantics.
* Coordination of multi-agent and collective systems: models, languages, infrastructures, self-adaptation, self-organisation, distributed solving, collective intelligence and emerging behaviour.
* Coordination and modern distributed computing: web services, microservices, peer-to-peer networks, grid computing, context-awareness, ubiquitous computing, mobile computing, reversible computing.
* Session-based programming: models, languages, behavioural types, and tools.
* Models, languages, verification techniques and tools for interacting smart contracts and (blockchain-based) decentralised applications.
* Languages, methodologies and tools for secure coordination. 
* Cybersecurity aspects of coordinated systems, coordinated approaches to cybersecurity.
* Nature- and bio-inspired approaches to coordination.
* Specification, refinement, and analysis of architectures: patterns and styles, verification of functional and non-functional properties, including performance and security aspects.
* Dynamic software architectures: distributed mobile code, configuration, reconfiguration, networked computing, parallel, high-performance and cloud computing.
* Coordination platforms for infrastructures of emergent new application domains, like IoT, fog- and edge-computing.
* Programming methodologies, languages, middleware, tools, and environments for the development and verification of coordinated applications, including DevOps approaches.
* Coordination in business process management: coordination models for business process management, process mining techniques and tools for coordination models.       
* Industrial relevance of coordination and software architectures: programming in the large, domain-specific software architectures and coordination models, industry-driven efforts in coordination and case studies.
* Interdisciplinary aspects of coordination.

### Submission categories:
* **Regular papers** (7-15 pages, not counting references and appendices): describing thorough and complete research results and experience reports. In a clear case of need, as an exception, authors may ask for permission via email to the PC co-chairs to exceed the paper’s max length by at most 10%, under the condition that last-minute shortening would really damage the clarity of the paper or result in non-submission. The authors must make a draft of the paper available to the PC co-chairs via EasyChair.
* **Short papers** (4-6 pages, not counting references and appendices): describing research in progress, call for action, or opinion papers on the past of COORDINATION research, on the current state of the art, or on prospects for the years to come.
* **Survey papers** (16-25 pages, not counting references and appendices): describing important results and success stories related to the topics of COORDINATION.
* **Tool papers** (4-15 pages, not counting references and appendices): describing technological artefacts in the scope of the research topics of COORDINATION. Tool papers should provide a clear account of the tool's functionality, discuss the tool’s practical capabilities possibly with reference to the type and size of problems it can handle, and,when applicable, report on realistic case studies (possibly providing a rigorous experimental evaluation). Tool papers may also provide an account of the theoretical foundations, including relevant citations, and present design and implementation concerns, possibly including software architecture and core data structures. Papers that present extensions to existing tools should clearly describe the improvements or extensions with respect to previously published versions of the tool, possibly providing data on enhancements in terms of resources and capabilities. Papers may contain a link to a publicly downloadable MPEG-4 demo video of at most 10 minutes length.
