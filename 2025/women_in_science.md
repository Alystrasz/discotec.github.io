# DisCoTec@Women in Science
>"*Les étoiles sont éclairées pour que chacun puisse un jour retrouver la sienne." 
Antoine de Saint-Exupéry*

The rapid advancement of computer science over the past decades is the result of groundbreaking contributions by researchers, both men and women, whose work has shaped our modern world. Among them, many women have had a significant impact. *Ada Lovelace*, often regarded as the world's first female programmer, envisioned the potential of computing long before modern computers existed and laid the foundations for algorithmic thinking. *Grace Hopper* designed the first compiler in 1951 and the Cobol language in 1959. These remarkable scientists, among many others, demonstrate the essential role women have played in the advancement of knowledge, and continue to inspire future generations, illuminating research and academia as ... stars.
