 Lille, France, 16-20 June 2025

 Submission deadline: 7 February 2025

 https://www.discotec.org/2025

************************************************************************

DisCoTec 2025 is one of the major events sponsored by the International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP) and the European Association for Programming Languages and Systems (EAPLS). It gathers conferences and satellite events that cover a broad spectrum of distributed computing subjects — from theoretical foundations and formal description techniques, testing and verification methods, to language design and system implementation approaches.


Subject to budget availability, we are planning to make special logistical arrangements for conference participants travelling with young children (and potentially accompanying persons). We invite interested persons to contact the General Chair, Simon Bliudze (https://www.bliudze.me/simon), as soon as possible to discuss the arrangements that might be applicable.
