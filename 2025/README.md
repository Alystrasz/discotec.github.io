The DisCoTec events will take place on the Campus Scientifique, which is located south-east of Lille in Villeneuve d'Ascq. The campus is about 7 km from the city center, where most hotels are located. We recommend staying in the center, as there is a  good metro connection with the campus. 

You can book accommodation using well-known platforms such as [booking.com](https://www.booking.com) and [airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com).

We are working on special arrangements for DisCoTec participamts; details will be made available as soon as possible.
 
Alternatively, we intend to block a limited number of rooms in selected hotels for DisCoTec participants. These rooms will be available on a first-come, first-served basis. To get details about prices and secure your booking, please check [here](./hotels).
