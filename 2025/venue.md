## About Lille

The city of Lille is the capital of the Hauts-de-France region, the most nothern region of France, and is at the center of the European Metropolis of Lille (MEL in French), which has a population of 1.5 million people.

Nicknamed the "capital of the Flanders", Lille belongs to the Flanders historical region, a hotly contested region through the ages; Lille has been strongly influenced (and under siege) by different powers, including
Holy Roman Empire and the Spanish Netherlands: this appears in the architecture of the buildings, especially in the city center and old town, that is very close to the neighbooring Belgium style.

There's a lot to see in Lille! Please visit the [tourist office website](https://en.lilletourism.com/) for official touristic information.

### The University of Lille

With roots from 1562, and officially established in 1854 with Louis Pasteur as first dean, the University of Lille comprises 15 faculties,
including the [Faculty of Science and Technology](https://sciences-technologies.univ-lille.fr/), which hosts the [Polytech Lille engineering school](https://www.polytech-lille.fr/english/graduate-school-of-engineering/).

The university employs 10,000 people (including 3,300 academic staff) and incorporates 80,000 students (including 1,800 Ph.D. students).


## How to arrive

We strongly encourage DisCoTec participants to consider sustainable options for arriving to Lille. 

### Travel by Train

Being 1h20 away from London, 1h from Paris and 35min from Bruxelles, Lille is an important junction of the European high-speed rail network.
Lille has two railways stations:
* Lille-Europe, meant for high-speed trains/international service;
* Lille-Flandres, meant for lower-speed regional service.

The two stations are very close (500m apart).

#### Companies

In France, trains are supervised by the SNCF (French national railway company).

In addition to SNCF's TGVs ([French high-speed trains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TGV)) going to Belgium, Italy and Spain, the SNCF also collaborates with other countries to propose international travels to/from Belgium/Germany/Netherlands/UK ([Eurostar](https://www.eurostar.com/rw-en)) and Switzerland ([Lyria](https://www.tgv-lyria.com/fr/en)).
Even though all aforementioned trains should be bookable through the [SNCF Connect website](https://www.sncf-connect.com/en-en/), don't hesitate to visit other companies' websites to double check.

*Note: SNCF Connect does not include trips from SNCF competitors (Deutsche Bahn, Renfe or Trenitalia for instance), so you might want to book your trip on [Trainline](https://www.thetrainline.com/).*

---

In France, there are two categories of high-speed journey: *inOui* is the name of the premium service, while *Ouigo* is the low-cost variant.
Both services usually run the same trains, [TGVs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TGV).

TGVs are comfortable; they all offer free Wi-Fi in both second and first class, and 220V outlets in first class.
Food and drinks are usually sold on the trains, except on short trips (no restauration service on Paris-Lille / Bruxelles-Lille for instance) and Ouigo low-cost trains.

### Travel by Air

The simplest option is to travel to [Lille-Lesquin Airport](https://www.lille.aeroport.fr/home/) (Lille, LIL), and then join Lille by bus (either Ilevia n°68 to Villeneuve-d'Ascq 4 cantons metro stations, or Flibco shuttle to Lille-Flandres railway station).

## Moving around the city

In the Lille Metropolis, public transportation (metro/tramway/bus/bike) is organized by [Ilevia](https://www.ilevia.fr/).
To plan your travel, you can also rely on Google Maps.

*Note: they say the Lille metro is the first fully automated driverless metro system in the world!*

## Accommodation

We strongly recommend booking a room **as soon as possible**: mid June is a busy period in the Lille area.

The DisCoTec events will take place on the Campus Scientifique, which is located south-east of Lille in Villeneuve d'Ascq. The campus is about 7 km from the city center, where most hotels are located. We recommend staying in the center, as there is a  good metro connection with the campus. 

You can book accommodation using well-known platforms such as [booking.com](https://www.booking.com) and [airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com).
 
Alternatively, we intend to block a limited number of rooms in selected hotels for DisCoTec participants. These rooms will be available on a first-come, first-served basis. To get details about prices and secure your booking, please check [here](./hotels).
