# Artefact Evaluation

Following [ACM's definition](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-and-badging-current), an artefact is "a digital object that was either created by the authors to be used as part of the study or generated by the experiment itself. For example, artifacts can be software systems, scripts used to run experiments, input datasets, raw data collected in the experiment, or scripts used to analyze results".

To improve and reward reproducibility and to give more visibility and credit to the effort of tool developers in the DisCoTec community, authors of submitted papers are invited to submit publicly available artefacts (using permanent repositories such as [Software Heritage](https://www.softwareheritage.org/howto-archive-and-reference-your-code/), [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), etc.), which will be associated with their paper for evaluation. Based on the result of the artefact evaluation, one or more badges may be applied to a paper. Specifically, DisCoTec uses the [EAPLS badging scheme)](https://eapls.org/pages/artifact_badges), which in its own turn is based on and consistent with the ACM initiative.

Artefact submission is mandatory for tool papers and the result of the artefact evaluation will be considered in the tool paper’s acceptance decision. Instead, artefact submission is optional for all the other paper categories and the result of the artefact evaluation will not affect the paper’s acceptance decision but may affect the best paper selection.
