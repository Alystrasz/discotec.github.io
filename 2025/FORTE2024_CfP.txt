===================================================================
Final CALL FOR PAPERS
FORTE 2024

Groningen, The Netherlands

EXTENDED DEADLINE February 23, 2024!

===================================================================

FORTE 2024 is one of the three conferences of DisCoTec 2024, the 19th International Federated Conference on Distributed Computing Techniques.

=== Topics of Interest ===

FORTE 2024 is a forum for fundamental research on theory, models, tools, and applications for distributed systems.

We invite submissions focused on foundational aspects of distributed software systems, presenting approaches or tools to formally model, soundly implement, and rigorously validate these demanding but ever more necessary systems and applications. As our dependency on such software systems grow, also our responsibility as researchers grows to provide both trustworthy and usable solutions.

The main topics of interest include:

- Language concepts for concurrency and distribution, supported by rigorous semantics, well-supported pragmatics, and/or expressive illustrative use-cases.

- Analyses techniques, methodologies, and/or algorithms, using testing and/or verification, to validate (aspects of) the soundness of various types of concurrent and distributed systems, including communication and network protocols, service-oriented systems, adaptive distributed systems, cyber-physical systems and sensor networks.

- Principles for qualitative and quantitative security analysis of distributed systems.

- Applications of formal methods and techniques for studying the quality, reliability, availability, and safety of concrete distributed systems. We are specially interested in “real-life” case studies and industrial applications involving real distributed systems.

- Emerging challenges and hot topics in distributed systems (broadly construed), such as software-defined networks, distributed ledgers, smart contracts, and blockchain technologies, etc.

=== Important Dates ===

For papers:

    Abstract submission: February 16, 2024 (Extended)
    Paper submission: February 23, 2024 (Extended)
    Paper notification: April 5, 2024 (Extended)
    Camera-ready: April 24, 2024

For artefacts:

    Artefact submission: February 29, 2024
    Problem reports from reviewers: 8 March, 2024
    Author response to reviewers: 15 March, 2024
    Artefact notification: March 29, 2024

DisCoTec conference: June 17-21, 2024

Deadlines expire at 23:59 (AoE, anywhere on earth) on the dates displayed above.

We solicit papers in the following categories:

- Regular papers (7-15 pages, not counting references): describing thorough and complete research results and experience reports. Regular papers may be combined with an artefact submission. Companion artefacts to regular submissions will be reviewed by the Artefact Evaluation Committee, but the acceptance of the paper is decoupled from the acceptance of the artefact (does not depend on it). The acceptance of the artefact, however, is conditional to the acceptance of the paper.

- Tool papers (7-15 pages, not counting references): describing technological artefacts in the scope of the research topics of FORTE. The paper should present the underlying theory of the tool, a clear account of the tool’s functionality and limitations, and include case studies (with rigorous experimental evaluation). In addition, the tool artefact must be submitted separately for evaluation. Acceptance of the tool artefact is mandatory for tool papers to be accepted. The artefact will be evaluated by a dedicated committee. The paper must contain a link to a publicly downloadable MPEG-4 demo video of at most 10 minutes, to be submitted until a week after the paper submission deadline.

- Short papers (up to 6 pages, not counting references): describing innovative and promising ideas, possibly in an early form, or demonstrating new tools (components), or presenting (i) calls to action, or (ii) substantiated reflections on current and/or future research perspectives related to FORTE, or a summary of a published journal paper clarifying why the presentation would enrich the program of FORTE.


See the website for EasyChair submission instructions. 



=== Proceedings ===

The proceedings of COORDINATION, DAIS, and FORTE will be published as volumes in the Springer LNCS-IFIP series.
The volumes will be open access from the IFIP digital library after a 3-year embargo.



=== Journal Special Issues ===

After the conference, accepted papers (except for tool papers) selected from FORTE and COORDINATION programmes will be invited to a journal special issue of the Logical Methods in Computer Science, with the following tentative schedule:

- October/November 2024: deadline for the first submitted version;
- February 2025: notification for the first round of reviews.

Selected tool papers will be invited to a journal special issue of Science of Computer Programming's Software Track.
