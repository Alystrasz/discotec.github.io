# DisCoTec 2022 - 17th International Federated Conference on Distributed Computing Techniques

[DisCoTec](https://www.discotec.org) 2022 is one of the major events sponsored by the International Federation for Information Processing ([IFIP](http://www.ifip.org)) and the European Association for Programming Languages and Systems ([EAPLS](https://eapls.org)). It gathers conferences and workshops that cover a broad spectrum of distributed computing subjects — from theoretical foundations and formal description techniques, testing and verification methods, to language design and system implementation approaches.



DisCoTec 2022 will take place at the [IMT School for Advanced Studies](http://www.imtlucca.it/en), Lucca, between June 13-17, 2022.  

**COVID-19:** We are monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic development. Depending on how this unfolds in the coming months, we are prepared to run the conference virtually or in a hybrid fashion in the unfortunate situation that a physical conference is not feasible. In the latter case, we would be happy to support remote presentations as well should participants be unable to travel safely.

<!--
Due to the current COVID-19 developments, the conference is still hosted by the [University of Malta](http://www.um.edu.mt) but it will be held **online**.  Instead of physical meeting/presentations, the authors of accepted papers have recorded their talks to discuss them with the conference participants online.-->
