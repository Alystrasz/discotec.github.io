# DisCoTec 2022 - 17th International Federated Conference on Distributed Computing Techniques

[DisCoTec](https://www.discotec.org) 2022 is one of the major events sponsored by the International Federation for Information Processing ([IFIP](http://www.ifip.org)) and the European Association for Programming Languages and Systems ([EAPLS](https://eapls.org)). It gathers conferences and workshops that cover a broad spectrum of distributed computing subjects — from theoretical foundations and formal description techniques, testing and verification methods, to language design and system implementation approaches.



DisCoTec 2022 will take place at the [IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca](http://www.imtlucca.it/en), between June 13-17, 2022.  

**COVID-19:** DisCoTec 2022 is planned as a physical, in-person event, with certain support for remote presence, 
both for speakers and for other participants who are unable or unwilling to come. Depending on the 
pandemic situation, we may have to make a decision whether to cancel the physical component of the 
event or not.

<!--
Due to the current COVID-19 developments, the conference is still hosted by the [University of Malta](http://www.um.edu.mt) but it will be held **online**.  Instead of physical meeting/presentations, the authors of accepted papers have recorded their talks to discuss them with the conference participants online.-->
