## FOCODILE 2022 - 3rd International Workshop on Foundations of Consensus and Distributed Ledgers

FOCODILE 2022 is one of the workshops at DisCoTec 2022, the 17th International Federated Conference on Distributed Computing Techniques.  

**COVID-19:** FOCODILE 22 is planned as a physical, in-person event, with certain support for remote presence, both for speakers and for other participants who are unable or unwilling to come. Depending on the 
pandemic situation, we may have to make a decision whether to cancel the physical component of the event or not.

### Scope
FOCODILE is a forum to exchange ideas and recent research findings on theoretical foundations of consensus and blockchain technology. Topics include, but are not limited to:

* Formal models of distributed consensus
* Blockchain-specific cryptographic primitives and protocols
* Formal verification of blockchain protocols and smart contracts
* Byzantine fault tolerance and consensus
* Design and analysis of distributed ledgers
* Blockchain consensus mechanisms
* Privacy and anonymity in cryptocurrencies
* Game-theoretic approaches to blockchains
* Post-quantum blockchain protocols
* Performance and scalability of blockchain systems

### Extended Abstract
FOCODILE has no formal proceedings. Novel research works or already published papers are welcome (in the form of extended abstracts).

### Important Dates
* Extended abstract submission deadline (Hard): May 11, 2022 (AoE)
* Notification of accepted talks: May 25, 2022
* Workshop: June 13, 2022

### Submission information
Extended abstract (2 pages + references) have to be submitted in PDF format using the EasyChair submission page [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=focodile2022](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=focodile2022)

The submissions must be prepared using Springerâ€™s LNCS style. Accepted submissions should be presented during the workshop day.
