# Scope
The DAIS conference series addresses all practical and conceptual aspects of distributed applications, including their design, modeling, implementation and operation, the supporting middleware, appropriate software engineering methodologies and tools, as well as experimental studies and applications. Submissions will be judged on their originality, significance, clarity, relevance, and technical correctness.

The topics of interest to the conference include, but are not limited to:

Novel and innovative distributed applications and systems, particularly in the areas of
* middleware,
* cloud, edge and fog computing,
* big data processing,
* streaming and complex event processing,
* distributed social networking,
* IoT and cyber-physical systems,
* mobile computing,
* advanced networking (SDN/NFV),
* micro-services and service-oriented computing,
* peer-to-peer systems, and
* data center and internet-scale systems.

Novel architectures and mechanisms, particularly in the areas of
* publish/subscribe systems,
* epidemic protocols,
* language-based approaches,
* virtualization and resource allocation,
* distributed storage,
* trusted execution environments,
* blockchains, cryptocurrencies and smart contracts, and
* distributed consensus mechanisms.

System issues and design goals, including
* interoperability and adaptation,
* self-* properties (e.g., self-organization, self-management,...),
* security and practical applications of cryptography,
* trust and privacy,
* cooperation incentives and fairness,
* fault-tolerance and dependability,
* scalability and elasticity, and
* tail-performance and energy-efficiency.

## Submission dates
See the [DisCoTec submission dates](https://www.discotec.org/2022/#important-dates).

## Submission and Publication

All papers must be original, unpublished, and not submitted for publication elsewhere. DAIS 2022 offers three submission tracks:

* Full research papers in no more than 15 pages + 2 pages references.
* Full practical experience reports, including experimental and evaluation studies, case studies, and practice reports in no more than 15 pages + 2 pages references.
* Work-in-progress papers, describing ongoing work and interim results, in no more than 6 pages + 2 pages references.

Contributions should be submitted electronically as PDF, using the Springer LNCS style to the conference submission website (...). Each paper will undergo a thorough process of peer reviews by the Program Committee. Reviewing is single-blind: author name(s) should appear. All papers accepted in any of the conference tracks will be included in the conference proceedings, which will be published by Springer-Verlag in the LNCS series. Proceedings will be made available at the conference. Submission implies that at least one author will register and attend the conference if the paper is accepted.

##Special Issue
Selected papers from DAIS'21 will be invited to a special issue of a reputed journal (to be announced soon).
