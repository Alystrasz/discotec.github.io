# COORDINATION 2022 - 24th International Conference on Coordination Models and Languages

COORDINATION 2022 is one of the three conferences of [DisCoTec 2022](https://www.discotec.org/2022/).

## COVID-19
COORDINATION 2022 is planned as a physical, in-person event, with certain support for remote presence, 
both for speakers and for other participants who are unable or unwilling to come. Depending on the 
pandemic situation, we may have to make a decision whether to cancel the physical component of the 
event or not.

<!--

We are monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic development and are prepared to run the conference virtually or in a hybrid fashion in the unfortunate situation that a physical conference is not feasible. The paper selection process will not be affected and LNCS proceedings will be prepared regardless of whether the conference is held physically, virtually or in a hybrid fashion.

 

## Keynote speakers

* [Gilles Fedak](invited#gilles-fedak), iExec, FR
* [Mira Mezini](invited#mira-mezini), Technical University of Darmstadt, DE
* [Alexandra Silva](invited#alexandra-silva), University College London, UK

## Scope
Modern information systems rely increasingly on combining concurrent, distributed, mobile, adaptive, reconfigurable and heterogeneous components. New models, architectures, languages and verification techniques are necessary to cope with the complexity induced by the demands of today's software development. Coordination languages have emerged as a successful approach, in that they provide abstractions that cleanly separate behaviour from communication, therefore increasing modularity, simplifying reasoning, and ultimately enhancing software development. Building on the success of the previous editions, this conference provides a well-established forum for the growing community of researchers interested in models, languages, architectures, and implementation techniques for coordination.

### Main topics

Topics of interest encompass all areas of coordination, including (but not limited to) coordination related aspects of:
* Theoretical models and foundations for coordination: component composition, concurrency, mobility, dynamic, spatial and probabilistic aspects of coordination, logic, emergent behaviour, types, semantics;
* Specification, refinement, and analysis of architectures: patterns and styles, verification of functional and non-functional properties, including performance and security aspects;
* Dynamic software architectures: distributed mobile code, configuration, reconfiguration, networked computing, parallel, high-performance and cloud computing;
* Nature- and bio-inspired approaches to coordination;
* Coordination of multi-agent and collective systems: models, languages, infrastructures, self-adaptation, self-organisation, distributed solving, collective intelligence and emerging behaviour;
* Coordination and modern distributed computing: web services, peer-to-peer networks, grid computing, context-awareness, ubiquitous computing, mobile computing;
* Coordination platforms for infrastructures of emergent new application domains like IoT, fog- and edge-computing;
* Cybersecurity aspects of coordinated systems, coordinated approaches to cybersecurity;
* Programming methodologies, languages, middleware, tools, and environments for the development and verification of coordinated applications;
* Tools, languages and methodologies for secure coordination;
* Industrial relevance of coordination and software architectures: programming in the large, domain-specific software architectures and coordination models, case studies;
* Interdisciplinary aspects of coordination;
* Industry-led efforts in coordination and case studies.

### Special topic

We seek contributions that enable the cross-fertilisation with other research communities in computer science or in other engineering or scientific disciplines.
Depending on the quality of the contributions, we plan to have dedicated sessions in the program, possibly together with a panel discussion.

    <p>Configurable Systems in the DevOps Era</p>

    <p>Highly configurable software systems, such as software product lines, 
call for automatic mechanisms that allow to tame the complexity and variability. 
DevOps have pushed forward the importance of automating every step 
of the software development process, including the management of configurable systems. 
In this special topic, we welcome submissions addressing novel techniques and methodologies 
for the COORDINATION of automatic configuration tasks or for the COORDINATION 
of the various phases from development to deployment supporting the continuous 
release of software/products.

<br>

Moreover, given the relevance of the topic to industry and aligned with the main topics of COORDINATION, 
we encourage submissions of efforts carried out in collaboration with industry, 
including case studies.</p>

<p>Microservices (in collaboration with the Microservices Community)</p>
 
<p style="float: left; width: 70%">The microservices architectural style is a recent paradigm that pushes the ideas of service-oriented computing to the extreme. In this style, applications are compositions of microservices: loosely-coupled entities that can be executed independently. A microservice should be small enough to be easily managed, modified, and if needed removed and rewritten from scratch. The aim is to obtain high flexibility, reconfigurability, and scalability, thanks also to the exploitation of container technologies (such as Docker). In this setting, coordination is essential: an application works only if the microservices coordinate well with each other, in order to reach their common goal. Establishing coordination techniques for obtaining the desired behaviour out of a system of microservices is therefore of the utmost importance.</p>

    <p>Techniques to reason about interacting digital contracts</p>

    <p>With the rise of blockchains and cryptocurrencies, digital contracts have become popular in the form of smart contracts, which encode a financial transaction between possibly distrusting parties using a distributed consensus protocol.  Although smart contracts bear the potential to benefit society quite fundamentally (e.g., equalize access to financial infrastructure, increase fairness), the benefits are shadowed by the existence of severe security vulnerabilities in deployed smart contracts and smart contract languages.  
In the 2022 edition of COORDINATION, we are soliciting contributions on new programming language paradigms and patterns for expressing digital contract interactions, verification and analysis techniques for checking safety and liveness properties and guaranteeing correctness of digital contracts, as well as compositionality and scalability of digital contract reasoning techniques.</p>

### Submission site

[https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=coordination2022](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=coordination2022)

### Publication 

Authors are invited to submit papers electronically in PostScript or PDF using a two-phase online submission process. Registration of the paper information and abstract (max. 250 words) must be completed according to the above submission dates and submissions are handled through the EasyChair conference management system, accessible from the above submission site.

Contributions must be written in English and report on original, unpublished work not submitted for publication elsewhere (cf. IFIP’s Author Code of Conduct, see [http://www.ifip.org/](http://www.ifip.org/) under Publications/Links). The submissions must not exceed the total page number limit (see below) prepared using [Springer’s LNCS style](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines). Submissions not adhering to the above specified constraints may be rejected without review.

**NOTE**: a lightweight rebuttal will be introduced during the reviewing phase, allowing reviewers to ask for a quick rebuttal in case of a clearly identifiable issue that seems decisive for the review outcome and which can likely be quickly clarified by the authors. The rebuttal is only used when such questions arise, so not necessarily for all papers.

Submission categories:
* Regular long papers (7-15 pages, not counting references): describing thorough and complete research results and experience reports.
* Regular short papers (4-6 pages, not counting references): describing research in progress or opinion papers on the past of COORDINATION research, on the current state of the art, or on prospects for the years to come.
* Short tool papers (4-6 pages, not counting references): describing technological artefacts in the scope of the research topics of COORDINATION. Short tool papers are not required to provide an account of theoretical foundations and are not required to present the design and implementation concerns. They should provide a clear account of the tool’s functionality and discuss the tool’s practical capabilities. **The paper must contain a link to a publicly downloadable MPEG-4 demo video of at most 10 minutes length.**
* Long tool papers (7-15 pages, not counting references): describing technological artefacts in the scope of the research topics of COORDINATION. A full-length tool paper should provide a brief account of the theoretical foundations (including relevant citations), present the design and implementation concerns (possibly including software architecture and core data structures),  provide a clear account of the tool’s functionality, discuss the tool’s practical capabilities (possibly with reference to the type and size of problems it can handle), and (when applicable) report on realistic case studies (possibly providing a rigorous experimental evaluation). Papers that present extensions to existing tools should clearly describe the improvements or extensions with respect to previously published versions of the tool (possibly providing data on enhancements in terms of resources and capabilities). **The paper must contain a link to a publicly downloadable MPEG-4 demo video of at most 10 minutes length.**
* Survey papers (16-25 pages, not counting references): describing important results and success stories that originated in the context of COORDINATION.

**ATTENTION**: if you believe that your submission is related to the special topic Microservices, then please indicate <b>Microservices</b> as the first of the <i>Author keywords</i> in the online submission system.

### Proceedings
The conference proceedings, formed by accepted submissions from any category, will be published by Springer in [LNCS-IFIP](https://www.springer.com/series/8345) volumes.

<img src="lncs-logo.jpg" width="182" height="68"/>

### Special issues

Following the tradition of previous editions of COORDINATION, depending on the quality and number of the submissions, we will organise special issues of selected papers in reputable journals like the journal of [Science of Computer Programming](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/science-of-computer-programming/)'s [Software Track](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/science-of-computer-programming/call-for-software/a-new-software-track-on-original-software-publications-science-of-computer-programming) for tool papers and the journal of [Logical Methods in Computer Science](https://lmcs.episciences.org) for the remaining categories.

## EAPLS Artefact Badging 

To improve and reward reproducibility and to give more visibility and credit to the effort of tool developers in our community, authors of accepted (regular and tool, short and long) papers will be invited to submit publicly available (using permanent repositories such as [Software Heritage](https://www.softwareheritage.org/howto-archive-and-reference-your-code/), [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), etc.) artefacts associated with their paper for evaluation, and based on the result of the evaluation they may be awarded one or more badges. See [EAPLS Artifact Badges](https://eapls.org/pages/artifact_badges/) for details. Artefact submission is optional and the result of the artefact evaluation will not alter the paper's acceptance decision. Detailed guidelines for the preparation and submission of the artefacts will be made available.
