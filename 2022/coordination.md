## Scope
Modern information systems rely increasingly on combining concurrent, distributed, mobile, adaptive, reconfigurable and heterogeneous components. New models, architectures, languages and verification techniques are necessary to cope with the complexity induced by the demands of today's software development. Coordination languages have emerged as a successful approach, in that they provide abstractions that cleanly separate behaviour from communication, therefore increasing modularity, simplifying reasoning, and ultimately enhancing software development. Building on the success of the previous editions, this conference provides a well-established forum for the growing community of researchers interested in models, languages, architectures, and implementation techniques for coordination.


### Main topics

Topics of interest encompass all areas of coordination, including (but not limited to) coordination related aspects of:
* Theoretical models and foundations for coordination: component composition, concurrency, mobility, dynamic, spatial and probabilistic aspects of coordination, logic, emergent behaviour, types, semantics;
* Specification, refinement, and analysis of architectures: patterns and styles, verification of functional and non-functional properties, including performance and security aspects;
* Dynamic software architectures: distributed mobile code, configuration, reconfiguration, networked computing, parallel, high-performance and cloud computing;
* Nature- and bio-inspired approaches to coordination;
* Coordination of multi-agent and collective systems: models, languages, infrastructures, self-adaptation, self-organisation, distributed solving, collective intelligence and emerging behaviour;
* Coordination and modern distributed computing: web services, peer-to-peer networks, grid computing, context-awareness, ubiquitous computing, mobile computing;
* Coordination platforms for infrastructures of emergent new application domains like IoT, fog- and edge-computing;
* Cybersecurity aspects of coordinated systems, coordinated approaches to cybersecurity;
* Programming methodologies, languages, middleware, tools, and environments for the development and verification of coordinated applications;
* Tools, languages and methodologies for secure coordination;
* Industrial relevance of coordination and software architectures: programming in the large, domain-specific software architectures and coordination models, case studies;
* Interdisciplinary aspects of coordination;
* Industry-led efforts in coordination and case studies.

### Special topic

We seek contributions that enable the cross-fertilisation with other research communities in computer science or in other engineering or scientific disciplines.
Depending on the quality of the contributions, we plan to have dedicated sessions in the program, possibly together with a panel discussion.

    <p>Configurable Systems in the DevOps Era</p>

    <p>Highly configurable software systems, such as software product lines, 
call for automatic mechanisms that allow to tame the complexity and variability. 
DevOps have pushed forward the importance of automating every step 
of the software development process, including the management of configurable systems. 
In this special topic, we welcome submissions addressing novel techniques and methodologies 
for the COORDINATION of automatic configuration tasks or for the COORDINATION 
of the various phases from development to deployment supporting the continuous 
release of software/products.

<br>

Moreover, given the relevance of the topic to industry and aligned with the main topics of COORDINATION, 
we encourage submissions of efforts carried out in collaboration with industry, 
including case studies.</p>

<p>Microservices (in collaboration with the Microservices Community)</p>
 
<p style="float: left; width: 70%">The microservices architectural style is a recent paradigm that pushes the ideas of service-oriented computing to the extreme. In this style, applications are compositions of microservices: loosely-coupled entities that can be executed independently. A microservice should be small enough to be easily managed, modified, and if needed removed and rewritten from scratch. The aim is to obtain high flexibility, reconfigurability, and scalability, thanks also to the exploitation of container technologies (such as Docker). In this setting, coordination is essential: an application works only if the microservices coordinate well with each other, in order to reach their common goal. Establishing coordination techniques for obtaining the desired behaviour out of a system of microservices is therefore of the utmost importance.</p>

    <p>Techniques to reason about interacting digital contracts</p>

    <p>With the rise of blockchains and cryptocurrencies, digital contracts have become popular in the form of smart contracts, which encode a financial transaction between possibly distrusting parties using a distributed consensus protocol.  Although smart contracts bear the potential to benefit society quite fundamentally (e.g., equalize access to financial infrastructure, increase fairness), the benefits are shadowed by the existence of severe security vulnerabilities in deployed smart contracts and smart contract languages.  
In the 2022 edition of COORDINATION, we are soliciting contributions on new programming language paradigms and patterns for expressing digital contract interactions, verification and analysis techniques for checking safety and liveness properties and guaranteeing correctness of digital contracts, as well as compositionality and scalability of digital contract reasoning techniques.</p>

### Tool papers

We welcome tool papers that describe experience reports, technological artefacts and innovative prototypes 
(including engines, APIs, etc.), for coordinating, modelling, analysing, simulating or testing systems, 
as well as educational tools in the scope of the research topics of COORDINATION. 
In addition, we welcome submissions promoting the integration of existing tools relevant to the community. 

<!--
**Submissions to the tool track must include a tool paper and a link to a demo video that previews the potential tool presentation at the conference. 
Both the tool paper and the video will be decisive criteria in the selection process.** 
Authors of accepted contributions 
will be able (and encouraged) to extend their tool paper to a (regular) full paper before appearance in the conference proceedings, 
which will be subject to a lightweight revision process.

A dedicated special issue for accepted contributions is being planned.
Tool papers presenting coordination APIs, allowing the broad community to easily utilise provided coordination mechanisms are particularly welcome. 

Interested authors can contact the tool track chairs for details.
