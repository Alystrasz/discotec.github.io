# First Workshop on Blockchain Technologies and Trusted Execution Environments


**COVID-19:** BlockTEE'22 is planned as a physical, in-person event, with certain support for remote presence, both for speakers and for other participants who are unable or unwilling to come. Depending on the 
pandemic situation, we may have to make a decision whether to cancel the physical component of the event or not.


Blockchains and TEE (trusted execution environments) are popular emerging technologies, enabling new or existing use cases to be deployed under stronger security and trust models. Blockchains and TEEs have been combined in the past to enhance the performance, security and applicability for blockchains. In this workshop, we invite novel combinations of these two technologies. Some of the topics we are interested into include practical results that show how to combine these two technologies to operate under stricter security models, offering new performance results, new proof-of-* systems enabled by TEEs, improvements over state-of-the-art ledgers exploiting TEEs, mixed or hybrid TEE deployments for distributed ledgers, or novel partitioning techniques dealing with heterogeneous TEE setups for blockchains. Real-world results from large-scale deployments combining TEEs and blockchains are highly encouraged.
