# First Workshop on Blockchain Technologies and Trusted Execution Environments


**COVID-19:** BlockTEE'22 is planned as a physical, in-person event, with certain support for remote presence, both for speakers and for other participants who are unable or unwilling to come. Depending on the 
pandemic situation, we may have to make a decision whether to cancel the physical component of the event or not.


# Scope

Blockchains and Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) are popular emerging technologies, enabling new or existing use cases to be deployed under stronger security and trust models. Blockchains and TEEs have been combined in the past to enhance the performance, security and applicability for blockchains. In this workshop, we invite novel combinations of these two technologies. Some of the topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
* practical results that show how to combine these two technologies to operate under stricter security models, 
* offering new performance results, 
* new proof-of-* systems enabled by TEEs, 
* improvements over state-of-the-art ledgers exploiting TEEs, 
* mixed or hybrid TEE deployments for distributed ledgers, 
* novel partitioning techniques dealing with heterogeneous TEE setups for blockchains
* real-world results from large-scale deployments combining TEEs and blockchains are highly encouraged.

# Submission

The first page must contain (1) title, (2) author names and affiliations, (3) contact author’s email, (4) abstract, and (5) indication of whether the paper is a full paper or a position paper as detailed below:

- a position paper should aim at fostering discussion and collaboration and may summarize research published elsewhere or outline emerging ideas. The submission must not exceed 4 pages excluding references. 
- full papers, presenting fleshed out ideas, systems and or experimental results. The submission must not exceed 12 pages excluding references.  


Contributions should be submitted electronically as PDF, using the Springer LNCS style to the conference submission website (https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=blocktee22). Each paper will undergo a thorough process of peer reviews by the Program Committee. 
Reviewing is single-blind: author name(s) should appear. 


We will have an *hybrid publication model*.
In the spirit of a workshop, the aim of this hybrid model is to facilitate the exchange of ideas and experiences via presentations of preliminary research results and ongoing work, as well as presentations of research work to a focussed audience.
Therefore, authors will be able to choose, after paper acceptance, if:
* (a) they intend to publish their paper with the conference/workshop proceedings’ editor 
* (b) they do not intend to take advantage of this option (and perhaps submit it elsewhere at a later point in time). 
 
The author's decision of publication mode is done after notification and hence has no bearing on the decision of whether to accept or reject a submission.
Submission implies that at least one author will register and attend the conference if the paper is accepted.
The registration fees for accepted papers is due regardless of the selected publication model.
