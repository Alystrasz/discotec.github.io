# First Workshop on Collaborative Mining for Distributed Systems


**COVID-19:** CoMinDs is planned as a physical, in-person event, with certain support for remote presence, both for speakers and for other participants who are unable or unwilling to come. Depending on the pandemic situation, we may have to make a decision whether to cancel the physical component of the event or not.

**Abstract**
EMbeDS is a newly established Department of Excellence of Sant'Anna School for Advanced Studies, Pisa, Italy, fostering the use of computer science and statistics in the Social Sciences. I joined EMbeDS in January 2020, and have since then interacted with people from social sciences like Economics, and Healthcare Management. In this talk, I will present the results of two ongoing collaborations centered on the use of Process Mining: 
- Methodological advancements where Process Mining and Statistical Model Checking contribute to the analysis and validation of simulation models like economic agent-based models, or threat analysis models;
- Application of Process Mining to study the Tuscan Regional Healthcare System - Process mining and clinical pathways: an application to breast cancer administrative data in Tuscany.

## Scope 

Nowadays, organizations increasingly need to coordinate to achieve their goals collaboratively and create new forms of business. This requires organizations to form (business-oriented) distributed systems, guaranteeing their interoperability. However, this task is made complex by the need to coordinate the interactions of various participants, dealing with requirements, constraints, and regulations coming from different organizations. In addition, many business scenarios started to involve more automated and highly distributed components such as robots and smart devices that perceive and interact with the dynamics arising from the physical world. 
Effective coordination and cooperation of such distributed systems demand the compatibility of the processes performed by each system component. Such cooperation can be supported by the observations of the whole systems’ behavior through collaborative mining, i.e., process mining applied in the presence of heterogeneous data produced by the system components, i.e., distributed event logs. Collaborative mining techniques address the discovery of collaborative models, thus fostering the coordination aspects that typically occur on distributed systems.
The objective of the CoMinDS workshop is to attract researchers and industry practitioners to discuss collaborative mining and present open challenges, state of the art, in-progress research, and practical experiences, including case studies. 

The topics of the workshop include, but are not limited to:
* Construction of Distributed Event Logs
* Discovery of Collaborative Models
* Conformance Analysis for Collaborative Models
* Multi-perspective Collaborative Mining
* Privacy-preserving Collaborative Process Mining
* Distributed Systems Monitoring and Repair
* Collaborative Decision Mining 
* Streaming Collaborative Mining

CoMinDs is an activity of the IEEE Task Force on Process Mining

## Special Call for Abstract
CoMinDS wellcomes submission of abstract about ongoing researches, case studies, ideas, and practical experiences. Notably, abstracts will not be part of the proceedings. Authors have to submit their abstract (max 1 page full width exluding references in [LNCS format](https://www.overleaf.com/project/62850169ea07884843d3d9c2) ) at [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cominds2022](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cominds2022). 

## Submission Guidelines
CoMinDS welcomes submissions of short papers (max 8 pages) presenting novel ideas, position statements, and preliminary results within the theme of collaborative mining and regular paper (max 15 pages) discussing original research works. 
Papers must be formatted using CEUR-ART format (one column style) available [http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-XXX/CEURART.zip](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-XXX/CEURART.zip), and must be submitted electronically via the EasyChair submission system, available at [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cominds2022](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cominds2022).

Proceedings shall be submitted to CEUR-WS.org for online publication. Selected, accepted research papers will be considered for publication in an extended and revised form in a  [special issue](https://www.springer.com/journal/607/updates/20210362) to be published in [Springer's Computing journal](https://www.springer.com/journal/607/).
