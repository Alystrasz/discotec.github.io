###  30+ years of FORTE research: a personal perspective

 I attended the first FORTE conference in Scotland in 1988, and have published in several FORTE conferences since then.  Over the past 34 years the field has changed!  Using six example applications, from 1989 to 2020, I reflect on how my own research in fundamental theory, models, and tools for distributed systems has evolved, and where we might focus  research in the future.

### Biography

 Dame Muffy Calder is a Professor of Computing Science and  Vice-Principal and Head of College of Science and Engineering, University of Glasgow. Previously she was the Chief Scientific Adviser for Scotland.  Her research interests are in computational modelling and automated reasoning for complex, interactive, and sensor-driven systems.  She is a member of the UK Prime Minister’s Council for Science and Technology, and she attended the very first FORTE conference in 1988.

### Challenges in automated measurement of pedestrian dynamics
Analyzing pedestrian dynamics has since long been an active and practical
field of interest. Since the introduction of, in particular, smartphones, various organizations
saw a simple means for automatically measuring pedestrian dynamics.
The basic idea is simple: network packets sent by WiFi-enabled devices can be
collected by sensors and by extracting the unique MAC address from each packet,
it should be possible to count how many devices are detected by a single sensor,
as well as how devices move between sensors. Although this approach has been
commercially deployed for many years, it is now largely forbidden (at least in the
EU) due to obvious privacy infringements. In this talk, we address challenges
and some potential solutions to automated measurement of pedestrian movements
while protecting privacy. The results come from learning the hard way: having run
experiments extensively over the past years, we have gradually gained considerable
insight in what is possible and what may lie ahead.


### Biography
MAARTEN VAN STEEN is professor at the University of Twente, where he
is scientific director of the Digital Society Institute.

He is specialized in large-scale distributed systems, mainly concentrating on very large wireless distributed systems. Recently, his attention has been drawn to security and privacy aspects of such systems, in particular related to crowd monitoring. His interests include many aspects of distributed systems reflected in publications on, for example, gossiping protocols, decentralized algorithms, peer-to-peer systems, location services, and Internet-based systems. His research is characterized by validating designs through experiments. 

Maarten van Steen is (co-)author of several textbooks, including "Distributed Systems," which is now in the process of being updated to its 4th edition. He is also written an introduction to graph theory and complex networks, aimed at first-year students in Computer and Information Sciences.

A large part of his current professional life is occupied by (research) management. Besides his role as Scientific Director, he is member of the daily board of the Dutch Science Foundation, chair of the Research & Innovation working group of the Dutch AI Coalition, and member of the Program Advisory Board for AiNed (a 400 MEuro national program on AI). Until 2020 he chaired the national ICT-research Platform Netherlands.

### Formal Methods for Socio-Technical Security (Formal and Automated Analysis of Security Ceremonies)

Software engineers and analysts traditionally focus on cyber systems as technical systems, which are built only from software processes, communication protocols, crypto algorithms, etc. They often neglect, or choose not, to consider the human user as a component of the system’s security as they lack the expertise to fully understand human factors and how they affect security. However, humans should not be designed out of the security loop. Instead, we must deal with security assurance as a true socio-technical problem rather than a mere technical one, and consider cyber systems as socio-technical systems with people at their hearts. The main goal of this talk is to advocate the use of formal methods to establish the security of socio-technical systems, and to discuss some of the most promising approaches, including those that I have helped develop.    

### Biography

Luca Viganò is Professor at the Department of Informatics of King's College London, UK, where he heads the Cybersecurity Group. His research focuses on formal methods and tools for the specification, verification and testing of cybersecurity and privacy. He is particularly interested in formal analysis of socio-technical systems, whose security depends intrinsically on human users, and of cyber-physical systems, where one needs to explicitly consider the underlying physical processes. He also works on explainable cybersecurity, where, in addition to more formal approaches, he has been investigating how different kinds of artworks can be used to explain cybersecurity and how telling (i.e., explaining notions in a formal, technical way) can be paired with showing through visual storytelling or other forms of storytelling. He is Global Envoy for King’s College London and Vice Dean (Enterprise & Engagement) of the Faculty of Natural, Mathematical & Engineering Sciences.
