# DisCoTec - International Federated Conference on Distributed Computing Techniques 

The DisCoTec series of federated conferences is one of the major events sponsored by the International Federation for Information Processing ([IFIP](http://www.ifip.org)). It gathers three main conferences:
* COORDINATION (IFIP WG6.1 International Conference on Coordination Models and Languages)
* DAIS (IFIP WG6.1 International Conference on Distributed Applications and Interoperable Systems)
* FORTE (IFIP WG6.1 International Conference on Formal Techniques for Distributed Objects, Components, and Systems)

Together, these conferences cover a broad spectrum of distributed computing subjects,
ranging from theoretical foundations and formal description techniques to systems
