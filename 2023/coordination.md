# COORDINATION 2023 - 25th International Conference on Coordination Models and Languages

COORDINATION 2023 is one of the three conferences of [DisCoTec 2023](https://www.discotec.org/2023/).

## Scope
Modern information systems rely increasingly on combining concurrent, distributed, mobile, adaptive, reconfigurable and heterogeneous components. New models, architectures, languages and verification techniques are necessary to cope with the complexity induced by the demands of today's software development. Coordination languages have emerged as a successful approach, in that they provide abstractions that cleanly separate behaviour from communication, therefore increasing modularity, simplifying reasoning, and ultimately enhancing software development. Building on the success of the previous editions, this conference provides a well-established forum for the growing community of researchers interested in models, languages, architectures, and implementation techniques for coordination.

### Main topics

Topics of interest encompass all areas of coordination, including (but not limited to) coordination related aspects of:
* Theoretical models and foundations for coordination: component composition, concurrency, mobility, dynamic, spatial and probabilistic aspects of coordination, logic, emergent behaviour, types, semantics;
* Specification, refinement, and analysis of architectures: patterns and styles, verification of functional and non-functional properties, including performance and security aspects;
* Dynamic software architectures: distributed mobile code, configuration, reconfiguration, networked computing, parallel, high-performance and cloud computing;
* Nature- and bio-inspired approaches to coordination;
* Coordination of multi-agent and collective systems: models, languages, infrastructures, self-adaptation, self-organisation, distributed solving, collective intelligence and emerging behaviour;
* Coordination and modern distributed computing: web services, peer-to-peer networks, grid computing, context-awareness, ubiquitous computing, mobile computing;
* Coordination platforms for infrastructures of emergent new application domains like IoT, fog- and edge-computing;
* Cybersecurity aspects of coordinated systems, coordinated approaches to cybersecurity;
* Programming methodologies, languages, middleware, tools, and environments for the development and verification of coordinated applications;
* Tools, languages and methodologies for secure coordination;
* Industrial relevance of coordination and software architectures: programming in the large, domain-specific software architectures and coordination models, case studies;
* Interdisciplinary aspects of coordination;
* Industry-led efforts in coordination and case studies.


### Tool papers

We welcome tool papers that describe experience reports, technological artefacts and innovative prototypes 
(including engines, APIs, etc.), for coordinating, modelling, analysing, simulating or testing systems, 
as well as educational tools in the scope of the research topics of COORDINATION. 
In addition, we welcome submissions promoting the integration of existing tools relevant to the community. 
Submissions to the tool track must include (in addition to the paper) a link to a demo video that previews 
the potential tool presentation at the conference.

### Submission site

[https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=coordination2023](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=coordination2023)

### Publication 

Authors are invited to submit papers electronically in PostScript or PDF using a two-phase online submission process. Registration of the paper information and abstract (max. 250 words) must be completed according to the above submission dates and submissions are handled through the EasyChair conference management system, accessible from the above submission site.

Contributions must be written in English and report on original, unpublished work not submitted for publication elsewhere (cf. IFIP’s Author Code of Conduct, see [http://www.ifip.org/](http://www.ifip.org/) under Publications/Links). The submissions must not exceed the total page number limit (see below) prepared using [Springer’s LNCS style](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines). Submissions not adhering to the above specified constraints may be rejected without review.

**NOTE**: a lightweight rebuttal will be introduced during the reviewing phase, allowing reviewers to ask for a quick rebuttal in case of a clearly identifiable issue that seems decisive for the review outcome and which can likely be quickly clarified by the authors. The rebuttal is only used when such questions arise, so not necessarily for all papers.

Submission categories:
* Regular long papers (7-15 pages, not counting references): describing thorough and complete research results and experience reports.
* Regular short papers (4-6 pages, not counting references): describing research in progress or opinion papers on the past of COORDINATION research, on the current state of the art, or on prospects for the years to come.
* Short tool papers (4-6 pages, not counting references): describing technological artefacts in the scope of the research topics of COORDINATION. Short tool papers are not required to provide an account of theoretical foundations and are not required to present the design and implementation concerns. They should provide a clear account of the tool’s functionality and discuss the tool’s practical capabilities. **The paper must contain a link to a publicly downloadable MPEG-4 demo video of at most 10 minutes length.**
* Long tool papers (7-15 pages, not counting references): describing technological artefacts in the scope of the research topics of COORDINATION. A full-length tool paper should provide a brief account of the theoretical foundations (including relevant citations), present the design and implementation concerns (possibly including software architecture and core data structures),  provide a clear account of the tool’s functionality, discuss the tool’s practical capabilities (possibly with reference to the type and size of problems it can handle), and (when applicable) report on realistic case studies (possibly providing a rigorous experimental evaluation). Papers that present extensions to existing tools should clearly describe the improvements or extensions with respect to previously published versions of the tool (possibly providing data on enhancements in terms of resources and capabilities). **The paper must contain a link to a publicly downloadable MPEG-4 demo video of at most 10 minutes length.**
* Survey papers (16-25 pages, not counting references): describing important results and success stories that originated in the context of COORDINATION.

<!--**ATTENTION**: if you believe that your submission is related to the special topic Microservices, then please indicate <b>Microservices</b> as the first of the <i>Author keywords</i> in the online submission system.

### Proceedings
The conference proceedings, formed by accepted submissions from any category, will be published by Springer in [LNCS-IFIP](https://www.springer.com/series/8345) volumes.

### Special issues

Following the tradition of previous editions of COORDINATION, depending on the quality and number of the submissions, we will organise special issues of selected papers in reputable journals like the journal of [Science of Computer Programming](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/science-of-computer-programming/)'s [Software Track](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/science-of-computer-programming/call-for-software/a-new-software-track-on-original-software-publications-science-of-computer-programming) for tool papers and the journal of [Logical Methods in Computer Science](https://lmcs.episciences.org) for the remaining categories.

## EAPLS Artefact Badging 

To improve and reward reproducibility and to give more visibility and credit to the effort of tool developers in our community, authors of accepted (regular and tool, short and long) papers will be invited to submit publicly available (using permanent repositories such as [Software Heritage](https://www.softwareheritage.org/howto-archive-and-reference-your-code/), [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), etc.) artefacts associated with their paper for evaluation, and based on the result of the evaluation they may be awarded one or more badges. See [EAPLS Artifact Badges](https://eapls.org/pages/artifact_badges/) for details. Artefact submission is optional and the result of the artefact evaluation will not alter the paper's acceptance decision. Detailed guidelines for the preparation and submission of the artefacts will be made available.
