# Call for Satellite Events Proposals: Workshops and Tutorials  — DisCoTec 2023

DisCoTec 2023 is one of the major events sponsored by the International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP) and the European Association
for Programming Languages and Systems (EAPLS). It gathers conferences and workshops that cover a broad spectrum of distributed computing subjects —
from theoretical foundations and formal description techniques, testing and verification methods, to language design and system implementation approaches.

Pre-conference workshops and tutorials will take place on **Monday, June 19, 2023**, and post-conference workshops on **Friday, June 23, 2023**.

## Workshops 

The DisCoTec 2023 organising committee solicits proposals for workshops to
provide a vivid and open forum for discussions among active researchers on
topics related to the distributed computing field. The aim is to facilitate
the exchange of ideas and experiences via presentations of preliminary
research results and ongoing works, as well as presentations of research
work to a focussed audience.

A workshop associated with DisCoTec 2023 can be one-day or half-day in
length. Workshop registration will be done together with the main
conferences, allowing workshop-only registrations as well.

A workshop proposal must include the following information:
  - name of the workshop
  - contact information of the Workshop Chair(s)
  - brief description of the aim and scope of the workshop (max. 500 words)
  - tentative Program and Organization Committees, if available
  - number of (expected) submissions and/or attendees
  - history of the workshop, if any, including the numbers of submissions,
    accepted papers, and attendees of the last edition
  - any other relevant information (e.g., invited speakers, panels)

**Important dates (for all workshops)**:
  - January 30, 2023: Workshop proposal submission deadline 
  - February 2, 2023: Notification of accepted workshop proposals
  - Mid April 2023: Workshop paper submission deadline
  - Mid May 2023: Notification of accepted workshop papers
