###  Principles of Persistent Programming

Persistent programming is the art of developing programs that operate on persistent (non-volatile) states that survive program termination, be it planned or abrupt (e.g. due to a power failure). Persistent programming poses several important challenges: 1) persistent systems have complex—and often unspecified—semantics in that operations do not generally persist in their execution order; 2) software bugs in persistent settings can lead to permanent data corruption; and 3) traditional testing techniques are inapplicable in persistent settings. Can formal methods come to the rescue?
