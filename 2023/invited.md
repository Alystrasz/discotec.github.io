###  Principles of Persistent Programming

Persistent programming is the art of developing programs that operate on persistent (non-volatile) states that survive program termination, be it planned or abrupt (e.g. due to a power failure). Persistent programming poses several important challenges: 1) persistent systems have complex—and often unspecified—semantics in that operations do not generally persist in their execution order; 2) software bugs in persistent settings can lead to permanent data corruption; and 3) traditional testing techniques are inapplicable in persistent settings. Can formal methods come to the rescue?

### Relating Message Passing and Shared Memory, Proof-Theoretically

At first sight, message passing concurrency is quite different from shared memory concurrency. Then we remember the well-known encoding of shared memory cells in the π-calculus and also implementations of message passing abstractions using shared memory. Such mutual encodings are significant, but far from straightforward and difficult to reason about rigorously.
We exhibit a strong bisimulation between asynchronous message passing concurrency with session types and shared memory concurrency with futures. A key observation is that both arise from closely related interpretations of the semi-axiomatic sequent calculus with recursive definitions, which provides a unifying framework. As a further result we show that the bisimulation applies to both linear and nonlinear versions of the two languages.
