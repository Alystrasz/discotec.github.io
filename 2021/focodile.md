## FOCODILE 2021 - 2nd International Workshop on Foundations of Consensus and Distributed Ledgers

FOCODILE 2021 is one of the workshops at [DisCoTec 2021](https://www.discotec.org/2021/), the 16th International Federated Conference on Distributed Computing Techniques. It will be held on June 18, 2021. 

COVID-19 update: in case of a physical event, remote participation will be possible. Please check the DisCoTec 2021 main page for more details.

### Scope
FOCODILE is a forum to exchange ideas and recent research findings on theoretical foundations of consensus and blockchain technology. Topics include, but are not limited to:

* Formal models of distributed consensus
* Blockchain-specific cryptographic primitives and protocols
* Formal verification of blockchain protocols and smart contracts
* Byzantine fault tolerance and consensus
* Design and analysis of distributed ledgers
* Blockchain consensus mechanisms
* Privacy and anonymity in cryptocurrencies
* Game-theoretic approaches to blockchains
* Post-quantum blockchain protocols
* Performance and scalability of blockchain systems


### Participation 

The event is invitation-based and will consist of oral presentations only. There will be no proceedings; abstracts of presented works may appear at the workshop's website. The event is open to all; registration details will be announced soon.

Researchers interested to present new, recent, or ongoing work should submit an abstract for consideration by the Organising Committee at focodile21@corelab.ntua.gr. Contributions from doctoral students and young researchers are particularly encouraged.
