* Workshops *

The DisCoTec 2021 organising committee invites proposals for workshops to complement the three main conferences. The aim is to provide a vivid and open forum for discussions, presentations of preliminary research results and ongoing work, as well as presentations of research work to a focussed audience.

The workshops will be held in conjunction with the main events. Prospective workshop chairs should contact the organisers and provide the following information:
 - contact information of the workshop chairs
 - name of the workshop
 - number of (expected) participants
 - brief description of the topic of the event (max. 500 words)
 - any other relevant information (e.g., invited speakers)

Important dates (for all workshops):
 - January 27, 2021: Workshop proposal submission deadline
 - February 1, 2021: Notification of accepted workshop proposals
 - Mid April, 2021: Workshop paper submission deadline
 - Mid May, 2021: Notification of accepted workshop papers
 - June 18, 2021: Workshops

The submission and notification deadlines of the workshops are at the discretion of the individual workshop chairs. However, the notification must be no later than the early registration deadline for DisCoTec 2021 (to be announced).
