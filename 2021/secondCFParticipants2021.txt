************************************************************************

DisCoTec 2021 is one of the major events sponsored by the International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP) and the European Association for Programming Languages and Systems (EAPLS). It gathers conferences and workshops that cover a broad spectrum of distributed computing subjects — from theoretical foundations and formal description techniques, testing and verification methods, to language design and system implementation approaches. 

As mentioned in our previous emails, DisCoTec 2021 will be held online again this year as a Zoom Webinar. Presentations will be recorded and broadcasted, followed by live Q&A sessions after each talk. 

The full programme is now available at https://www.discotec.org/2021/programme.
