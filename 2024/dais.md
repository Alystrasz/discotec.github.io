# DAIS 2024 - 24th International Conference on Distributed Applications and Interoperable Systems

DAIS 2024 is one of the three conferences of [DisCoTec 2024](.).

# Scope
The DAIS conference series addresses all practical and conceptual aspects of distributed applications, including their design, modeling, implementation and operation, the supporting middleware, appropriate software engineering methodologies and tools, as well as experimental studies and applications. Submissions will be judged on their originality, significance, clarity, relevance, and technical correctness.

The topics of interest to the conference include, but are not limited to:

Novel and innovative distributed applications and systems, particularly in the areas of
* middleware,
* cloud, edge and fog computing,
* big data processing,
* distributed embedded machine learning (TinyML),
* streaming and complex event processing,
* distributed social networking,
* IoT and cyber-physical systems,
* mobile computing,
* advanced networking (SDN/NFV),
* micro-services and service-oriented computing,
* peer-to-peer systems, and
* data center and internet-scale systems.

Novel architectures and mechanisms, particularly in the areas of
* publish/subscribe systems,
* epidemic protocols,
* language-based approaches,
* virtualization and resource allocation,
* distributed storage,
* trusted execution environments,
* blockchains, cryptocurrencies and smart contracts, and
* distributed consensus mechanisms.

System issues and design goals, including
* interoperability and adaptation,
* self-* properties (e.g., self-organization, self-management,...),
* security and practical applications of cryptography,
* trust and privacy,
* cooperation incentives and fairness,
* fault-tolerance and dependability,
* scalability and elasticity, and
* tail-performance and energy-efficiency.

## Keynote speakers

* [Marieke Huisman](https://wwwhome.ewi.utwente.nl/~marieke/) (University of Twente, NL)
* [Laura Kovács](http://lkovacs.com/) (Vienna University of Technology, AT)
* [Paulo Veríssimo](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/study/faculty/paulo-verissimo) (KAUST, SA)

## Submission dates
* Abstract submission: February 2, 2024
* Paper submission: February 9, 2024
* Paper notification: March 29, 2024
* Camera-ready: April 28, 2024
* DisCoTec conference:  June 17-21, 2024


Deadlines expire at 23:59 anywhere on earth on the dates displayed above.

## Submission and Publication

All papers must be original, unpublished, and not submitted for publication elsewhere. DAIS 2024 offers three submission tracks:

* Full research papers in no more than 15 pages + 2 pages references.
* Full practical experience reports, including experimental and evaluation studies, case studies, and practice reports in no more than 15 pages + 2 pages references.
* Work-in-progress papers, describing ongoing work and interim results, in no more than 6 pages + 2 pages references.

Contributions should be submitted electronically as PDF, using the [Springer LNCS style](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines) to the conference submission website. Each paper will undergo a thorough process of peer reviews by the Program Committee. Reviewing is single-blind: author name(s) should appear.

## Proceedings
All papers accepted in any of the conference tracks will be included in the conference proceedings, which will be published by Springer-Verlag in in [LNCS-IFIP](https://www.springer.com/series/8345) volumes.
Proceedings will be made available at the conference. Submission implies that at least one author will register and attend the conference if the paper is accepted.

## Artefact Submission
To improve the reproducibility of results and to increase the visibility of prototypes and tools produced by our community, authors of accepted papers (full papers, experience reports, WiP papers) will be invited to submit publicly available artefacts associated with their paper for evaluation.
Based on the result of the evaluation, the paper may be awarded with badges. Artefact submission is optional and the result of the artefact evaluation will not alter the paper’s acceptance decision. Detailed guidelines for the preparation and submission of the artefacts will be made available to authors.
