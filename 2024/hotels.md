# Hotels in Groningen


DisCoTec 2024 will take place in Groningen, The Netherlands (see information about the venue [here](venue)).
We strongly recommend booking a room **as soon as possible**: mid June is a busy period in the Groningen area. 

The DisCoTec events will take place in the Zernike campus, which is located in the north part of the city. The campus is about 4 km from the city center, where most hotels are located. Still, we recommend staying in the center, as there are good bus connections with the Zernike campus. 

You can book accommodation using well-known platforms such as [booking.com](https://www.booking.com) and [airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com).
 
Alternatively, we have blocked a limited number of rooms in selected hotels for DisCoTec participants. These rooms are available on a first-come, first-served basis. To get details about prices and secure your booking, please follow the instructions below.
