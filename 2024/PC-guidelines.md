Dear...

Thank you for accepting to be on the FORTE Program Committee for 2024. The paper bidding will be open from today and close on Monday. We have received 32 abstracts but we might receive one or two additional papers by the deadline.

Make sure to declare any conflicts to help us with our eventual paper assignments.

Once you receive your paper allocations, we expect your review reports to reach us by Friday, March 29. You are welcome to use subreviewers, but you should also develop your own position concerning each paper for the PC discussion.

Review reports should address technical correctness, presentation of the work, significance (progress wrt state-of-the-art) and novelty. 
Although paper weaknesses should be clearly identified, we would like to see a proper effort to recognise a paper's strong points as well.  Invariably, criticisms should be done in a constructive manner by suggesting also ways to improve the paper. 

FORTE has grown to have a fairly broad community. Whenever you feel the state-of-the-art was not surveyed properly, do not hesitate to provide an explicit list of the missing references.  Also, we'd rather
not see reviews hastily ruling out papers for being out of scope. 

Thank you in advance for your time and effort!





We expect reports to
polite. Weaknesses of a paper should of course be stated,
but never in a way that insults the author's person.

Please do your best to deliver timely and high-quality reviews.
Even if you are not positive, try to be constructive and
to suggest ways to improve the paper.
Be specific - for example, if you feel that some related works
are not discussed, provide an explicit list of the missing references.

Also consider that SEFM is a broad community, and we'd rather
not see reviews just ruling out papers for being out of scope.

Dear Adrian,

We received 59 full papers. Based on your bid, we have produced
an assignment of papers to review for each PC member.

Please find your list of papers below.

If you notice a conflict of interest that wasn't already declared,
please alert us immediately.

We need your reviews by 29 June. This will leave us a week for
discussions until the notification date of 6 July.

Please upload your reports by the deadline, we need
the buffer week for discussions.

You are welcome to use subreviewers, but you should also develop your
own position concerning each paper for the PC discussion.

You will be able to invite subreviewers formally through Easychair
(but an informal pre-invitation by personal email may help you).

Subreviewers will be able  to upload their reports to Easychair
directly. Still, you need to approve each subreviewer report in the
system.

We expect thorough and impartial review work. The reports should
address technical correctness, presentation of the work, significance
(progress wrt state-of-the-art), novelty. We expect reports to
polite. Weaknesses of a paper should of course be stated,
but never in a way that insults the author's person.

Thank you in advance for your time and effort! And thanks once againg
for agreeing to serve on the PC in the first place.

Bernd and Tarmo

very unlikely situation - please let us know asap.
