# FORTE 2024 - 44th International Conference on Formal Techniques for Distributed Objects, Components, and Systems

FORTE 2024 is one of the three conferences of [DisCoTec 2024](.), the 19th International Federated Conference on Distributed Computing Techniques.

## Topics of Interest
FORTE 2024 is a forum for fundamental research on theory, models, tools, and applications for distributed systems.

We invite submissions focused on foundational aspects of distributed
software systems, presenting approaches or tools to formally model,
soundly implement, and rigorously validate these demanding but ever
more necessary systems and applications. As our dependency on such
software systems grow, also our responsibility as researchers grows to
provide both trustworthy and usable solutions.

The main topics of interest include:
* Language concepts for concurrency and distribution, supported by
  rigorous semantics, well-supported pragmatics, and/or expressive
  illustrative use-cases.
* Analyses techniques, methodologies, and/or algorithms, using testing
  and/or verification, to validate (aspects of) the soundness of
  various types of concurrent and distributed systems, including
  communication and network protocols, service-oriented systems,
  adaptive distributed systems, cyber-physical systems and sensor
  networks.
* Principles for qualitative and quantitative security analysis of
  distributed systems.
* Applications of formal methods and techniques for studying the
  quality, reliability, availability, and safety of concrete
  distributed systems. We are specially interested in "real-life" case
  studies and industrial applications involving real distributed
  systems.
* Emerging challenges and hot topics in distributed systems (broadly
  construed), such as software-defined networks, distributed ledgers,
  smart contracts, and blockchain technologies, etc.

### Submission Guidelines
Contributions must be written in English according to one of the three categories described below. Apart from journal-first papers, all papers should report on original, unpublished work, not submitted for publication elsewhere (cf. [IFIP codes of conduct](http://www.ifip.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=219&Itemid=564), under Links).

Submissions must be prepared as a PDF using [Springer’s LNCS style](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines). Submissions not adhering to the specified constraints of their respective category may be rejected without review.

### Categories of Papers
All papers should be submitted in LNCS format. We solicit papers in the following categories:
* __Regular papers__ (7-15 pages, not counting references): describing thorough and complete research results and experience reports. Regular papers may be combined with an artefact submission. Companion artefacts to regular submissions will be reviewed by the Artefact Evaluation Committee, but the acceptance of the paper is decoupled from the acceptance of the artefact (does not depend on it). The acceptance of the artefact, however, is conditional to the acceptance of the paper.
* __Tool papers__ (7-15 pages, not counting references): describing technological artefacts in the scope of the research topics of FORTE.  The paper should present the underlying theory of the tool, a clear account of the tool’s functionality and limitations, and include case studies (with rigorous experimental evaluation). In addition, the tool artefact must be submitted separately for evaluation. Acceptance of the tool artefact is mandatory for tool papers to be accepted. The artefact will be evaluated by a dedicated committee.  The paper must contain a link to a publicly downloadable MPEG-4 demo video of at most 10 minutes, to be submitted until a week after the paper submission deadline.
* __Short papers__ (up to 6 pages, not counting references): describing innovative and promising ideas, possibly in an early form, or demonstrating new tools (components), or presenting (i) calls to action, or (ii) substantiated reflections on current and/or future research perspectives related to FORTE, or a summary of a published journal paper clarifying why the presentation would enrich the program of FORTE.


### Artefact Submission and Evalution Guidelines

FORTE 2024 includes an artefact evaluation performed by the artefact evaluation committee (AEC). Refer to this [**page**](forte_ae.md) for additional details.

<!--
### Partial Rebuttal
Some papers that raised doubts the reviewers would like to clarify to consider acceptance, will have 48h to respond to concrete questions. The responses will be taken into account during the PC discussions.
