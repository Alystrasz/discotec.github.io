# COORDINATION 2024 - Artefact Evaluation

[COORDINATION](https://www.discotec.org/2024/coordination) this year includes an artefact evaluation performed by 
the artefact evaluation committee (AEC). The goal of the artefact evaluation is to enable future researchers to 
more effectively build on and compare with previous work. The Artefact Evaluation Committee (AEC) will review 
the artefact. We will be attributing 3 badges, according to [EAPLS guidelines](https://eapls.org/pages/artifact_badges/):

1. Artefact **functional**: documented, consistent, complete, exercisable;
2. Artefact **reusable**: exceeding functional, by being carefully documented and well-structured for reuse and repurposing, see below for details;
3. Artefact **available**: available on a publicly accessible archival repository to a permanent repository that provides a Digital Object Identifier (DOI).

Authors of **regular papers** are invited (but not required) to submit a relevant artefact for evaluation by the artefact evaluation committee (AEC). 
Authors of **tool papers** are required to submit an artefact to the AEC and this artefact should satisfy at least the requirements for the 
**functional badge**. Acceptance of tool papers is conditional on successful artefact evaluation.

Members of the artefact evaluation committee and the program committee are asked to use submitted artefacts 
for the sole purpose of evaluating the contribution associated with the artefact.
