### Scope
Interaction and Concurrency Experiences (ICEs) is a series of international scientific meetings oriented to theoretical computer science researchers with special interest in models, verification, tools, and programming primitives for complex interactions.

The general scope of the venue includes theoretical and applied aspects of interactions and the synchronization mechanisms used among components of concurrent/distributed systems, related to several areas of computer science in the broad spectrum ranging from formal specification and analysis to studies inspired by emerging computational models.

We solicit contributions relevant to Interaction and Concurrency, including but not limited to:
* Formal semantics
* Process algebras and calculi
* Models and languages
* Protocols
* Logics and types
* Expressiveness
* Model transformations
* Tools, implementations, and experiments
* Specification and verification
* Coinductive techniques
* Tools and techniques for automation
* Synthesis techniques
