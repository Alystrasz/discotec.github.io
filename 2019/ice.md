## Scope
Interaction and Concurrency Experiences (ICEs) is a series of international scientific meetings oriented to theoretical computer science researchers with special interest in models, verification, tools, and programming primitives for complex interactions.

The general scope of the venue includes theoretical and applied aspects of interactions and the synchronization mechanisms used among components of concurrent/distributed systems, related to several areas of computer science in the broad spectrum ranging from formal specification and analysis to studies inspired by emerging computational models.

We solicit contributions relevant to Interaction and Concurrency, including but not limited to:
* Formal semantics
* Process algebras and calculi
* Models and languages
* Protocols
* Logics and types
* Expressiveness
* Model transformations
* Tools, implementations, and experiments
* Specification and verification
* Coinductive techniques
* Tools and techniques for automation
* Synthesis techniques

## Selection Procedure

Since its first edition in 2008, the distinguishing feature of ICE has been an innovative paper selection mechanism based on an interactive, friendly, and constructive discussion amongst authors and PC members in an online forum. 

During the review phase, each submission is published in a dedicated discussion forum. The discussion forum can be accessed by the authors of the submission and by all PC members not in conflict with the submission (the forum preserves anonymity). The forum is used by reviewers to ask questions, clarifications, and modifications from the authors, allowing them better to explain and to improve all aspects of their submission. The evaluation of the submission will take into account not only the reviews, but also the outcome of the discussion.

As witnessed by the past nine editions of ICE, this procedure considerably improves the accuracy of the reviews, the fairness of the selection, the quality of camera-ready papers, and the discussion during the workshop.

ICE adopts a light double-blind reviewing process, detailed below.

## Submission Guidelines

We invite two types of submissions:

- **Research papers**, original contributions that will be published in the workshop post-proceedings. Research papers must not be simultaneously submitted to other conferences/workshops with refereed proceedings. Research papers should be 3-16 pages plus at most 2 pages of references. Short research papers are welcome; for example a 5 page short paper fits this category perfectly.

- **Oral communications** will be presented at the workshop, but will not appear in the post-proceedings. This type of contribution includes e.g. previously published contributions, preliminary work, and position papers. There is no strict page limit for this kind of submission but papers of 1-5 pages would be appreciated. For example, a one page summary of previously published work is welcome in this category.

Authors of research papers must omit their names and institutions from the title page, they should refer to their other work in the third person and omit acknowledgements that could reveal their identity or affiliation. The purpose is to avoid any bias based on authors’ identity characteristics, such as gender, seniority, or nationality, in the review process.  Our goal is to facilitate an unbiased approach to reviewing by supporting reviewers’ access to works that do not carry obvious references to the authors’ identities. As mentioned above, this is a lightweight double-blind process. Anonymization should not be a heavy burden for authors, and should not make papers weaker or more difficult to review. Advertising the paper on alternate forums (e.g., on a personal web-page, pre-print archive, email, talks, discussions with colleagues) is permitted, and authors will not be penalized by for such advertisement. 

Papers in the “Oral communications” category need not be anonymized.  For any questions concerning the double blind process, feel free to consult the ICEcreamers.  

We are keen to enhance the balanced, inclusive and diverse nature of the ICE community, and would particularly encourage female colleagues and members of other underrepresented groups to submit their work.

Submissions must be made electronically in PDF format via [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ice20190).


## Publications

Accepted research papers and communications must be presented at the workshop by one of the authors.

Accepted research papers will be published after the workshop in [Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science](http://eptcs.org/).

We plan to invite authors of selected papers and brief announcements to submit their work in a special issue in the Journal of Logical and Algebraic Methods in Programming (Elsevier). Such contributions will be regularly peer-reviewed according to the standard journal policy, but they will be handled in a shorter time than regular submissions. A list of published and in preparation special issues of previous ICE editions is reported below.
