## Accommodation and local information

Hotels in Copenhagen (recommended)
* We recommend to stay close to the Nørreport station, as it is central area of the city and it is very well connected with both the Airport (direct metro line, 15 minutes) and with the campus (bus lines 150S and 15E, 25 minutes). You will have to commute every day to the campus (half an hour each way) but it will be easier to enjoy the beautiful city of Copenhagen and to find nice restaurants for dinner.
* A list of hotels in that area can be found in [booking.com](https://www.booking.com/searchresults.en-gb.html?label=gen173nr-1BCAEoggJCAlhYSDNYBGg9iAEBmAEGuAEHyAEM2AEB6AEBkgIBeagCAw&sid=526f40f28fb1d9d93bba8d197e3c8adb&class_interval=1&dest_id=1764&dest_type=landmark&dtdisc=0&from_sf=1&group_adults=2&group_children=0&inac=0&index_postcard=0&label_click=undef&lang=en-gb&map=1&no_rooms=1&offset=0&postcard=0&raw_dest_type=landmark&room1=A%2CA&sb_price_type=total&search_selected=1&soz=1&src=index&src_elem=sb&ss=N%C3%B8rreport%20Station%2C%20K%C3%B8benhavn%2C%20Region%20Hovedstaden%2C%20Danmark&ss_all=0&ss_raw=n%C3%B8rreport&ssb=empty&sshis=0&lang_click=top&cdl=da&lang_changed=1&nflt=#map_closed)

Hotels in Lyngby
* If you prefer to stay close to the campus and avoid the commute we recommend the [Scandic Eremitage](https://www.scandichotels.dk/hoteller/danmark/kobenhavn/scandic-eremitage) (expensive, located in the center of Lyngby and with public transportation) and the [Hotel Fortunen](http://www.fortunen.dk/) (cozy and cheaper, better suited for bike commuting, not well connected with public transportation but you can rent bikes at the hotel).
* Further options can be found in [booking.com](https://www.booking.com/searchresults.en-gb.html?label=gen173nr-1FCAEoggJCAlhYSDNYBGg9iAEBmAEGuAEHyAEM2AEB6AEB-AELkgIBeagCAw&sid=526f40f28fb1d9d93bba8d197e3c8adb&class_interval=1&dest_id=-2745593&dest_type=city&from_sf=1&group_adults=2&group_children=0&label_click=undef&lang=en-gb&no_rooms=1&offset=0&raw_dest_type=city&room1=A%2CA&sb_price_type=total&search_selected=1&soz=1&src=index&src_elem=sb&ss=Kongens%20Lyngby%2C%20Region%20Hovedstaden%2C%20Danmark&ss_raw=lyngb&ssb=empty&lang_click=top&cdl=da&lang_changed=1&nflt=)
