# COORDINATION 2019 - 21st International Conference on Coordination Models and Languages

Coordination 2019 is one of the three conferences of [DisCoTec 2019](https://www.discotec.org/2019/).

## Keynote Speakers
* [David Basin](https://www.inf.ethz.ch/personal/basin/) (ETH Zürich, Switzerland)
* [Anne-Marie Kermarrec](https://www.irisa.fr/asap/?page_id=179) (INRIA Rennes, France)
* [Marta Kwiatkowska](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/marta.kwiatkowska/) (University of Oxford, UK)
* [Silvio Micali](https://people.csail.mit.edu/silvio/) (MIT, USA)  
* [Martin Wirsing](https://www.sosy-lab.org/people/wirsing/) (LMU, Germany)

## Scope
Modern information systems rely increasingly on combining concurrent, distributed, mobile, adaptive, reconfigurable and heterogeneous components. New models, architectures, languages and verification techniques are necessary to cope with the complexity induced by the demands of today's software development. Coordination languages have emerged as a successful approach, in that they provide abstractions that cleanly separate behaviour from communication, therefore increasing modularity, simplifying reasoning, and ultimately enhancing software development. Building on the success of the previous editions, this conference provides a well-established forum for the growing community of researchers interested in models, languages, architectures, and implementation techniques for coordination.

## Main topics of interest

Topics of interest encompass all areas of coordination, including (but not limited to) coordination related aspects of:
* Theoretical models and foundations for coordination: component   composition, concurrency, mobility, dynamic, spatial and probabilistic aspects of coordination, logic, emergent behaviour, types, semantics;
* Specification, refinement, and analysis of architectures: patterns and styles, verification of functional and non-functional properties, including performance and security aspects;
* Dynamic software architectures: distributed mobile code, configuration, reconfiguration, networked computing, parallel, high-performance and cloud computing;
* Nature- and bio-inspired approaches to coordination;
* Coordination of multiagent and collective systems: models, languages, infrastructures, self-adaptation, self-organisation, distributed solving, collective intelligence and emerging behaviour;
* Coordination and modern distributed computing: web services, peer-to-peer networks, grid computing, context-awareness, ubiquitous computing, mobile computing;
* Coordination platforms for infrastructures of emerging new application domains like IoT, fog- and edge- computing;
* Programming methodologies, languages, middleware, tools, and environments for the development and verification of coordinated applications;
* Tools, languages and methodologies for secure coordination;
* Industrial relevance of coordination and software architectures: programming in the large, domain-specific software architectures and coordination models, case studies;
* Interdisciplinary aspects of coordination;
* Industry-led efforts in coordination and case studies.

## Submission dates

See the [DisCoTec submission dates](https://www.discotec.org/2019/#important-dates). 

## Submission and publication

Authors are invited to submit full papers electronically in PostScript or PDF using a two-phase online submission process. Registration of the paper information and abstract (max. 250 words) must be completed according to the [DisCoTec submission dates](https://www.discotec.org/2019/#important-dates). Submissions are handled through the EasyChair conference management system, accessible from the conference web site: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=coordination2019](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=coordination2019)

Contributions must be written in English and report on original, unpublished work not submitted for publication elsewhere (cf. IFIP’s Author Code of Conduct, see http://www.ifip.org/ under Publications/Links). The submissions must not exceed the total page number limit (see below) prepared using Springer’s LNCS style. Submissions not adhering to the above specified constraints may be rejected without review. Papers should be submitted as PDF or PS via EasyChair.

Submission categories:
* Full papers (up to 15 pages + 2 pages references): describing thorough and complete research results and experience reports.
* Short papers (up to 6 pages + 2 pages references): describing research in progress or opinion papers on the past of Coordination research, on the current state of the art, or on prospects for the years to come.
* Survey papers (up to 25 pages + 2 pages references): describing important results and successful stories that originated in the context of COORDINATION. 

The conference proceedings, formed by accepted submissions will be published by Springer in the LNCS Series.
