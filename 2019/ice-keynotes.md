**Title**: Smart digital contracts

**Abstract**: The term 'smart contract' was informally introduced as ``a computerized transaction protocol that executes the terms of a contract'' (Szabo, 1994). It has been popularized in Ethereum, where it is an object encapsulating an account balance, written in a reactive, object-oriented programming language  that is executed on a decentralized replicated deterministic state machine (Buterin, 2014; Wood, 2014). Based on the REA accounting model (McCarthy, 1982) and a semantic model of contracts as event sequence classifiers (Andersen et al, 2006), we deconstruct a smart contract into a *digital contract* with a formal mathematical semantics that represents the terms of a contract; its *life-cycle management*, which executes, validates and monitors contract events; and its *resource management* (who owns what) in both decentralized (blockchain/distributed ledger) and centralized systems. We describe CSL, a compositional digital contract specification language in use and active development at Deon Digital (https://hub.docker.com/r/deondigital/vitznauerstock) and report on formalizing its denotational and operational semantics and proving their coherence in Coq as a basis for guaranteed sound static analysis and certified security guarantees. 

**Bio**: Fritz Henglein is Professor of Programming Languages and Systems at DIKU, the Department of Computer Science at the University of Copenhagen (UCPH) and Head of Research at Deon Digital AG, a start-up developing secure and scalable digital contract technology for both decentralized (blockchain, distributed ledger) and centralized systems. His research contributions are in semantic, logical and algorithmic aspects of programming languages, functional programming, domain-specific languages, digital contracts, reporting and analytics, smart contracts and blockchain/distributed ledger systems. Since 2015 he has served as general chair, program committee member and steering committee member of programming language conferences (including POPL, ICFP, PEPM, FHPC); as editor/ editorial board member of Journal of Functional Programming; as steering committee chair of the Danish Innovation Network for Finance IT; Kurator at Fraunhofer Institute of Software and Systems Technology; Mercator Fellow at TU Dortmund; member of IFIP Working Groups 2.1 and 2.8; co-founder and advisory board member of several start-ups; and in a variety of roles at the department, faculty and university level at the University of Copenhagen.
