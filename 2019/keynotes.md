Title: Security Protocols:  Model Checking Standards

Abstract: The design of security protocols is typically approached as an art, rather than a science, and often with disastrous consequences. But this need not be so!  I have been working for ca. 20 years on foundations, methods, and tools, both for developing protocols that are correct by construction and for the post-hoc verification of existing designs.  In this talk I will introduce my work in this area and describe my experience analyzing, improving, and contributing to different industry standards, both existing and upcoming.

Title: Towards Formally Designing Collective Adaptive Systems<br>
in cooperation with Lenz Belzner, Thomas Gabor, Rolf Hennicker, and Alexander Knapp

Abstract: Many modern software systems are distributed and consist of interacting entities that have to cope at runtime with dynamically changing environments and possibly also with new requirements. We call such systems ensembles or – in case the entities are collaborating - collective adaptive systems. Examples are robot swarms and also socio-technical systems such as smart city or smart health care applications. As the interactions between the participants of an ensemble may lead to unexpected reactions and as unforeseen functionalities may be needed in order to react correctly to changes of the environment, conventional software development techniques and approaches – be they agile or waterfall - might not provide adequate support. Novel rigorous engineering techniques are needed where mathematical as well as artificial intelligence techniques and foundational methods play a prominent role. This talk presents a systematic approach for designing ensembles including an ensemble engineering life cycle, an ensemble specification method based on dynamic logic and two complementary approaches to adaptation:  role-based adaptation modelling and online planning using reinforcement learning.
