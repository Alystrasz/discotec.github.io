**Title**: Security Protocols:  Model Checking Standards

**Abstract**: The design of security protocols is typically approached as an art, rather than a science, and often with disastrous consequences. But this need not be so!  I have been working for ca. 20 years on foundations, methods, and tools, both for developing protocols that are correct by construction and for the post-hoc verification of existing designs.  In this talk I will introduce my work in this area and describe my experience analyzing, improving, and contributing to different industry standards, both existing and upcoming.

**Title**: Making Sense of Fast Big Data

**Abstract**: Computing systems that make human sense of big data, usually called personalization systems or recommenders,  and popularized by Amazon and Netflix, essentially help Internet users extracting  information of interest to them. Leveraging machine learning techniques, research on personalization has mainly focused on improving the quality of the information extracted, according to some measure of quality. Yet, building an operational recommender goes far beyond, especially in a world where data is not only big but also changes very fast. This talk will discuss system challenges to scale to a large number of users and a growing volume of fastly changing data to eventually provide real-time personalization.

**Short Bio**: Anne-Marie Kermarrec is a senior researcher at Inria, France where she led a research group on large-scale distributed systems from 2006 to 2015. She is currently the CEO of the [Mediego](https://www.mediego.com/en/) startup that she founded in April 2015. Mediego provides content personalisation services for online publishers, and directly builds on her recent research. She got a PhD thesis from University of Rennes, and has been with Vrije Universiteit, NL and Microsoft Research Cambridge, UK. Anne-Marie received an ERC grant in 2008 and an ERC proof of Concept in 2013. She received from the French Academy of Science  the Montpetit Award  in 2011 and the Innovation Award in 2017. She has been elected to the European Academy in 2013 and named ACM Fellow in 2016. Her research interests are large-scale distributed systems, peer to peer networks and system support for machine learning.

**Title**: Towards Formally Designing Collective Adaptive Systems<br>
in cooperation with Lenz Belzner, Thomas Gabor, Rolf Hennicker, and Alexander Knapp

**Abstract**: Many modern software systems are distributed and consist of interacting entities that have to cope at runtime with dynamically changing environments and possibly also with new requirements. We call such systems ensembles or – in case the entities are collaborating - collective adaptive systems. Examples are robot swarms and also socio-technical systems such as smart city or smart health care applications. As the interactions between the participants of an ensemble may lead to unexpected reactions and as unforeseen functionalities may be needed in order to react correctly to changes of the environment, conventional software development techniques and approaches – be they agile or waterfall - might not provide adequate support. Novel rigorous engineering techniques are needed where mathematical as well as artificial intelligence techniques and foundational methods play a prominent role. This talk presents a systematic approach for designing ensembles including an ensemble engineering life cycle, an ensemble specification method based on dynamic logic and two complementary approaches to adaptation:  role-based adaptation modelling and online planning using reinforcement learning.
