## Highlights

Two new categories of submissions added!
* **[special topics](#special-topics)**: we seek for contributions that enable the cross-fertilisation with other research communities in computer science or in other engineering or scientific disciplines.
* **[tool papers](#tool-papers)**: we seek for video+paper submissions on tools related to coordination

See the [submission section](#submissions) below for details.

## Scope
Modern information systems rely increasingly on combining concurrent, distributed, mobile, adaptive, reconfigurable and heterogeneous components. New models, architectures, languages and verification techniques are necessary to cope with the complexity induced by the demands of today's software development. Coordination languages have emerged as a successful approach, in that they provide abstractions that cleanly separate behaviour from communication, therefore increasing modularity, simplifying reasoning, and ultimately enhancing software development. Building on the success of the previous editions, this conference provides a well-established forum for the growing community of researchers interested in models, languages, architectures, and implementation techniques for coordination.

      In many actor-based programming models, asynchronous method calls communicate their results using futures,
 where the fulfilment occurs under-the-hood. Promises play a similar role to futures, except that they must be explicitly created and explicitly fulfilled;
this makes promises more flexible than futures, though promises lack fulfilment guarantees: they can be fulfilled once, multiple times or not at all. Unfortunately, futures are too rigid to exploit many available concurrent and parallel patterns. For instance, many computations block on a future to get its result only to return that result immediately (to fulfil their own future).
To make futures more flexible, we explore a construct, forward, that delegates the responsibility for fulfilling the current implicit future to another computation. Forward reduces synchronisation and gives futures promise-like capabilities. This paper presents a formalisation of the forward construct, defined in a high-level source language, and a compilation strategy from the high-level language to a low-level, promised-based target language.
The translation is shown to preserve semantics. Based on this foundation, we describe the implementation of forward in the parallel, actor-based language Encore, which compiles to C.

      Security policies are important for protecting digitalized information, control resource access and maintain secure data storage. This work presents the development of a policy language to transparently incorporate aggregate programming and privacy models for distributed data. We use tuple spaces as a convenient abstraction for storage and coordination. The language has been designed to accommodate well-known models such as k-anonymity
      and (ùúÄ,ùõø)-differential privacy, as well as to provide generic user-defined policies. The formal semantics of the policy language and its enforcement mechanism is presented in a manner that abstracts away from a specific tuple space coordination language. To showcase our approach, an open-source software library has been developed in the Go programming language and applied to a typical coordination pattern used in aggregate programming applications.
